# UNO GAME
This is a simple uno game for a linux terminal.

The only requirments are a computer that can run python and bash, and a terminal that accepts ansii escape sequences.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/tillay/uno&&cd uno&&./install.sh

To play in the future, make sure you are in the uno directory and run: python3 main.py

Modification:
to change number of starting cards and type of game (singleplayer or against computer) run the installer script again

to change the width of each column, modify the instance varaible with width = 10. Not reccomended unless you dont prefer base 10

(numbers also get kinda offset too)

I didnt add AI at all, the computer version is programmed to only play valid cards with no strategy

im working on a 2 player version with 2 ppl on same ssh server but its a buncha work and confusing
